### How it works? 🤨
This plugin allows you to see the players through walls, it's very useful for server administrators to catch cheaters or just to spectate the game in a different way.
Is not supposed to be used by regular players, so it's restricted to admins only.

**Available commands:**
- `!wh` - Enable/Disable the ESP.
- `!esp` - Enable/Disable the ESP.
